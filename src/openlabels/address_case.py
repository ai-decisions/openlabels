"""Chain-aware address case policy.

Lowercasing is canonical ONLY where the address alphabet is case-insensitive:
  - EVM ``0x`` + 40 hex (EIP-55 checksum case is display-only);
  - bech32/bech32m (``bc1``/``tb1``/``ltc1`` — single-case by spec, canonical
    form is lowercase).
Everywhere else (base58check and friends: BTC legacy ``1…``/``3…``, LTC
``L…``/``M…``, DOGE ``D…``, DASH ``X…``, XRP ``r…``, TRON ``T…``, SOL, XMR
``4…``/``8…``, ZEC ``t1…``/``t3…``) case IS payload: lowercasing destroys the
address irreversibly.

This module exists because a blanket ``.lower()`` in ingest code once
destroyed tens of thousands of base58 label rows (BTC + SOL + XMR + XRP,
measured) before the policy was made explicit. Every ingest
script MUST normalize through :func:`canonical_case` and every label-set
gate MUST count :func:`is_case_destroyed`.

Caveat on detection: a genuine base58 string CAN be naturally all-lowercase
(no uppercase letters drawn) — measured rate roughly 1 in 100,000
addresses. ``is_case_destroyed`` is therefore a high-precision heuristic for
COUNTING/flagging, not a proof for any single address.
